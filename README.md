# Talking a little about the past

Teacher explained that in the past we had different browsers implementing different ways to do the same thing and Brendan Eich and Ecma made a standard to do several things. They generated standards as example ECMAScript 6 (or 2015). They recommend the use od ECMA Script modules and teacher also made this recommendation, enforcing that you also will see several libraries using this type of modularization.
