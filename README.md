# Talking a little about the past

Teacher explained that in the past we had different browsers implementing different ways to do the same thing and Brendan Eich and Ecma made a standard to do several things.

They recommend the use od ECMA Script modules and teacher also made this recommendation, enforcing that you also will see several libraries using this type of modularization.
